# AutoProxifier
Small desktop (electron) app that takes MTG deck stubs from tappedout and routes the deck list through mtgpress so you can print proxies.

To use:
1) Download and set up the application as per the latest release instructions.
2) Locate the stub of the tapped out deck you would like to proxy
   * Ex: from http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/one-squirrel-two-squirrels-6mil-squirrels-1/ the stub would be one-squirrel-two-squirrels-6mil-squirrels-1
3) Run the AutoProxifier application, paste in stub, press accept
4) When MTG Press loads, you may change the set any card is from by hovering over it
5) Optionally, adjust the zoom % to make cards larger/smaller and add lines between them at the top
6) Press print at the top or bottom
